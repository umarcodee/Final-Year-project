## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.16.0 or higher
- Dart 3.0.0 or higher
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter plugins
- Physical device (camera required for FACE  detection)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   cd FYP
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Configure API Keys**
    - Get Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console
    - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in:
        - `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
        - `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`
4. **Generate Hive adapters**
   ```sh
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```
5. **Run the app**
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform-Specific Setup

**Android**
- Minimum SDK: 21
- Target SDK: 34
- Permissions automatically requested at runtime

**iOS**
- Minimum iOS: 11.0
- Camera and location permissions configured in `Info.plist`
- Background modes enabled for continuous monitoring

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### ML Kit Detection Parameters

Edit in `app_constants.dart`:
```dart
static const double eyeClosureThreshold = 0.4;
static const double yawnDetectionThreshold = 0.6;
static const int drowsinessDetectionFrames = 5;
```

### Notification Settings

Customize alert behaviors:
```dart
static const String alertSoundPath = 'assets/sounds/alert_beep.mp3';
static const Duration alertCooldown = Duration(seconds: 10);
```

---

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- Local Data Storage: All detection data stored locally using Hive
- No Cloud Dependency: ML processing happens on-device
- Privacy First: No personal data transmitted to servers
- Secure SMS: Emergency contacts managed locally
- Permissions: Minimal required permissions requested

---

## 🔄 State Management

Uses Provider pattern for reactive state management:
- `DrowsinessProvider`: ML detection state and camera management
- `LocationProvider`: GPS and nearby places functionality
- `SettingsProvider`: App preferences and configuration
- `ChatbotProvider`: AI assistant conversation management

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. Detection Accuracy: Test with various lighting conditions
2. Emergency Response: Verify SMS and location sharing
3. Performance: Monitor battery usage during detection
4. UI Responsiveness: Test on different screen sizes
